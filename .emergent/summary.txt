**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Core Business:** Offer smart home solutions (touch panels, lighting/fan/motor control, CCTV, sensors) and provide 1-year free service.
- **Initial Design:** The project started with a Royal Enfield-inspired design, then pivoted to a lighter, professional style inspired by , and finally settled on a strict, minimalist black-and-white monochrome theme.

    - Social media links in the footer (YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, X).
    - Interactive elements like a chatbot and a Product Selector tool.
    - Clear CTAs (Request a Demo, Learn More) and responsive design.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A comprehensive frontend for the smart home website has been developed using React. It includes multiple pages (Home, Products, Product Detail, About, Contact) and specialized components like a hero carousel, chatbot, and a product selector tool. The site features a theme-toggle for dark/light modes, routing between pages, and incorporates the user's brand logos. All functionality and data are currently mocked via , with no backend integration yet.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was in the middle of a major design overhaul to implement a strict monochrome (black and white) color scheme across the entire website, as per the user's latest request. This involved removing all existing accent colors (like blue) from every component, button, link, and hover state to adhere to a pure black-and-white aesthetic for both light and dark themes. The agent had updated , , and  but had not yet applied the changes to all other components.

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  Issue 1:  Incomplete Monochrome Theme Implementation (P0)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - **Description**: The user mandated a strict two-color theme (pure black and white) for the entire site. The agent started this work but did not complete it, leaving the site in a visually inconsistent state with a mix of old and new color schemes.
     - **Attempted fixes**: The agent updated the base CSS variables in  and modified  and . However, most other components still contain hardcoded color classes (e.g., , ) that need to be removed.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1. Systematically go through every  file under  and .
       2. Search for and replace all Tailwind CSS color utilities that are not  or  (e.g., , , , , etc.).
       3. Pay special attention to interactive states (, ) and UI elements like , , and  to ensure they conform to the monochrome scheme.
       4. Key files to review include: , , , , , , and .
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the user's most critical and recent design requirement. Completing it will finalize the website's visual identity and prepare it for the next phase of development.
     - **Status**:  IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?** N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- There are no other in-progress tasks. The monochrome theme is the sole focus.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
- **P1: Enhance Individual Product Page:**
  - **File:** 
  - **Task:** Implement a carousel/slider for 3-5 product images, show available color options, and add detailed specifications in a structured format. This is currently a placeholder page.
- **P2: Refine Contact Us Page:**
  - **File:** 
  - **Task:** Enhance the page for better usability and design consistency. This is a subjective task requiring a design review and potential layout adjustments.

**Future Tasks:**

  - **Task:** This is the next major phase. It involves:
    1.  Creating backend models and API endpoints (in ) for products, contact form submissions, etc.
    2.  Migrating the entire frontend from mock data () to live API calls using .
    3.  Implementing the logic for the product search functionality.
    4.  Making the chatbot functional by connecting it to a backend service or logic.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Frontend Scaffolding:** Built a multi-page React application with routing.
- **Component Creation:** Developed numerous components, including , , , , , , and .
- **Page Creation:** Created separate pages for , , , and .
- **Feature Implementation (Mocked):**
  - Integrated user-provided logos and branding (, ).

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript (JSX), Tailwind CSS for styling, Shadcn/UI for components.
- **Routing:**  for client-side navigation between pages.
- **State Management:** Local component state using React Hooks (, ).
- **Data:** All application data is currently hardcoded in .
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) server exists but is not yet integrated with the frontend features.
- **Database:** MongoDB is configured but not yet utilized for the application.

**key DB schema**
  - **status_checks**:  (from template, not app-specific)
  - No application-specific schemas (e.g., for products, contacts) have been defined yet.

**changes in tech stack**
  - None. The project uses the provided React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack.

**All files of reference**
- : Main application entry point, defines routes and overall layout.
- : Central source of all content for the frontend. Crucial for understanding the current data structure.
- : Contains the base Tailwind CSS directives and custom CSS variables that are being modified for the monochrome theme.
- : Contains navigation links and the theme toggler.
- : Implements the product grid with hover effects and search bar.
- : Contains a summary of the project and a TODO list of pending tasks.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The entire frontend needs to be refactored to remove the dependency on  and integrate with a live backend via API calls.
- CSS color classes are inconsistently applied across components. The ongoing monochrome refactoring aims to fix this, but a final cleanup pass will be necessary.

**key api endpoints**
- : Default health check endpoint.
- No application-specific endpoints have been implemented yet.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Monochrome Theme is Mandatory:** The user's most recent and firmest instruction is to use a strict black-and-white color scheme. Do not introduce any other colors. This is the highest priority task.
- **Mock Data Driven:** The entire frontend is powered by . No backend logic has been implemented for the application's features.
- **Iterative Development:** The project has undergone several major design pivots based on user feedback. Be prepared for further refinements. The  contains a TODO list agreed upon with the user.
